## Essence Checklist: Way of working

We are in state **In Place** because: 
We are using established practices and tools (communicatoin over discord and using github, have a workflow for gitHub, have setup the repo so that we ensure that we are all running the same environment etc). All team members have access to the tools and inspect the way of working, by discussing it during meetings.
 
In order to reach **Working Well** we need to: Continue to work with these tools to ensure that they are applied naturally. Git and discord now work well, but other parts such as using a standardized environment and way of commenting are still not natural and we still make mistakes. Furthermore, we have some problems distributing work especially in early stages and need more practice distributing work in clear and atomic issues from an early point in the project. We need to practice more with these tools.
